# QNR Template Plugin

Basic WordPress plugin with a settings page, serving as a starting point for plugin development.

A few standard input types are featured on the settings page: text inputs, checkbox, radio buttons, and a popup menu.

The code is commented and clearly structured. If there is anything you don't understand, read the Plugin API documentation on [WordPress](WordPress.org).
